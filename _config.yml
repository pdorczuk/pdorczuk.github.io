subtitle: PCI DSS auditor by day. Tech guy with a passion for cloud, containers, coding, and automation by night.

  I'm an experienced PCI DSS QSA with about a decade of performing external audits for all kinds of businesses and 
  environments. Additionally, I have a strong penchant to tinker and build while trying to automate a lot of the more 
  tedious parts of my job.

  Over the past several years, I have heavily focused my attention on learning everything I can about Kubernetes, 
  GitOps, DevOps, CI/CI, and Infrastructure as Code. I also know just enough Bash and Python to be dangerous and I 
  enjoy coding small scripts and apps.

  I made this site to share my tools, thoughts, and processes around engineering and automating compliance and auditing.
